# Fast I/O #
- use "\n" instead of endl 
- scanf and printf is faster than cin and cout 

---

# Useful library #
## vector ##
- allow insertions and deletions no need care size of array 
- support erase , push_front , insert 

## queue ##
- FIFO -> BFS 

## set / map ##
- useful to maintain sorted items with moderate search (> array & < hashing)

# unorder_set / unordered_map ##
- fast search insert delete (O(1))

## priority_queue ##
- implement max heap 
- find min or max ele 

## deque ##
- insertions and deletions at O(1) time 
- support random access -> use dequeue to implement queue and stack

# C++ tricks ##
1. Use 'auto' keyword to declare data types 
2. use c++ stl 
3. '_gcd(a,b)' for finding gcd
