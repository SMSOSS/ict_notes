- Suggest a Data Type
    - Should be text / string.
    - char = 1 single character, making this answer unfeasable
         - `char [8]` may work as it specifies 8 characters.
    
- Common notes and errors
    - Quotation will not change anything (so it's ok)
    - Separate field names with commas, not `AND`.
    - Use `*` instead of listing all data (be lazy)
        - `*` does NOT require quotation !!
    - Use quotation on text. Those are case-sensitive.
    - Don't add Dollar sign / other characters if it doesn't exist in data.
    - need AND / OR when specifying Condition
    - Use brackets when `COUNT` (count *)
    - There is no function named `MAXIMUM`. Don't make your own functions up.
    - `GROUP BY` is important when you need to sort data.
