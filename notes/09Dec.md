# ICT Lesson, December 9 Notes #

## 1. Imaging ##

- What is Video quality? (1080p 720p etc) 
        - `p` isn't only used for videos btw 
        - 720p is classified as HD 
        - 1080p is classified as HD on YouTube 
                - 1080p = Video that consists Images of 1920x1080 
                - 1080i = Used when TVs only had 50Hz refresh rate 
                        - Generate half an image per scan, to trick our brain that we're seeing the full image 
                                - 25fps 
        - 2K = 2560x1440 
        - 4K = 3840x2160 
        - 8K = 7680x4320 
        - Keep in mind that as the resolution increases, the size of the file will increase too 

## 2. Image Compression ##

- What if my tablet has a 2K monitor but the source only has 1080p? 
        - oh no! Compression will be involved. 
        - Compression is divided into 2 kinds, lossy and loseless conversion. 
                - Lossy conversion = Displays the colors close enough to be useful 
                        - Not a lot of detail can be seen as it only combines similar colors 
                - Loseless conversion = Displays all colors truly 
                        - Will have a lot of detail as it isn't combining similar colors 

## P.S. : Citation on lossy  ##
- The term is (widely?) used in Java
- Lossy conversion = Convert a data type (e.g. int) to another data type (e.g. float)
        - It will be "close enough" to original dataset but will have it's own differences.
