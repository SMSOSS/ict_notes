# ICT Lesson, June 1 Notes #

## 1. URL ##
- Web address
- Full form: Uniform Resource Locator
- www (world wide web) is only one of the subdomains
- Different subdomain traces to different server
- Domain names have been asked multiple times in HKDSE
- URLs can be used in emails too!

## 2. Protocols for web browsing ##
- HTTP / HTTPS (Encryption related)
    - HTTPS is relatively more secure and save you from man-in-the-middle attacks
- FTP
    - File Transfer Protocol
    - Requires FTP server
        - Can be any computer installed with FTP server program
    - Connect by IP / Domain name (usually IP?)
    - Connect using FTP Clients
        - Online clients
            - e.g. OnlineFTP
        - Installed (program) clients
            - e.g. Filezilla 
        - Client connect into server and do Transfer / Receive work
        - very very specific channel. not Google Drive / WhatsApp / etc
        - Actually very efficient and fast
