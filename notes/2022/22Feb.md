# ICT Lesson, 22 Feb notes #

## 1. Visual Display Unit ##
- Visual Display unit (projectors)
    - Very big category
    - Monitors
        - CRT (gone since long)
            - Very durable but is extremely large
        - Plasma (gone since long)
            - very expensive
        - LCD
            - Liquid Crystal Display
            - Newer technology
            - How does it work?
                - A light behind the screen give light
                - The Liquid Crystal change reflection rate when current pass through
                - Different color will then be shown on the screen
        - LED
            - Newer technology
            - Similar to LCD
                - Basically same with LCD except the points on screen can glow without a light in back
        - LCD vs LED
            - Full black: LCD will not be full black (still have a bit light); LED will actually be full black (that's how AMOLED  black works)
    - TVs
        - Similar with a monitor (but is NOT a monitor)
        - Can do more stuff (e.g. receive TV signals)
    - TV wall
        - Multiple TV combine to show 1 thing
    - LED Walls
        - Basically big LED display
        - If you walk closely you can see a lot of led light bulb
    - Touchscreens
        - Invented in Hong Kong (TM)


    - New stuff: Contrast Ratio & Refresh Rate

## 2. Refresh rate ##
    - 60Hz / 120Hz / 144Hz / 160Hz
    - The higher the refresh rate, the more images in a second
    - The more images in a second, the more times the screen reloads the image
    - If camera refresh rate > screen refresh rate, you may be able to see flicker in image.
