# ICT Lesson, Feb 16 Notes #

## 1. Input devices ## 
- Keyboards
    - Can be used to input stuff to computers (e.g. text, most common)
    - Electronic piano keys are keyboard too! ($60000 piano rich ymc xd)

- Pointing Devices
    - Cursor (commonly known as "mouse")
    - Alternatives include:
        - Track point
        - Trackball (mouse but controlled by a ball)
            - Very cool tech, and is actually very easy to use
    - Pointing devices are used in GUI and rarely in CLI
        - GUI = Graphical user interface
            - What you usually use (unless you're some tech expert / like to use wm)
            - Windows, MacOS (Aqua WM), most Linux distros all have GUIs
        - CLI = Command line interface
            - Mostly only requires a keyboard to use
            - Key bindings are very important (memorize!!!)
            - Mostly more efficient than GUI because GPU and others has less workload
        - Extra: some WMs
            - Textbook won't cover this but it's common
            - (some) Window managers in Linux do NOT require a mouse, but it is GUI
            - Some examples are i3 and BSPWM (what I use)
            - Key bindings are very important

- Drawing pads / handwriting boards
    - Another type of pointing device
    - Simulates mouse input according to pen's behavior
    - Drawing pads are usually larger and handwriting boards are usually smaller
    - osu :p

- Joystick
    - Similar to gear (Ê≥¢Ê£ç) in cars
    - Again, simulates mouse input
        - Actually treated as a separate device, has it's own keylayout and own key functions
        - Don't write this in DSE

- Video game controllers
    - Similar to Joystick but made for Playstation / XBOX
    - Requires additional drivers to work natively on PCs
    - Similar to Joysticks so just refer to that

- Scanners
    - Document Scanner
        - Scans documents
    - Flatbed Scanner 
    - Barcode Scanner
        - Scans barcodes
    - QR Code scanner
        - Scans QR Codes
    - There are a lot more types of scanners that scans different stuff

- Refer to textbook 2 p.38 for more.
