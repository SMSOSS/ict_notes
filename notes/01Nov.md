- structure similar to spreadsheet->excel (database operation more complicate + can't generate chart on database)
- why need database ? -> good at handle large amount of data (Excel will be slow compare to database still fast)
- proper cmd -> easily filter + get some data 
- convenient to merge some table (Excel can't merge easily between sheets)
- gen report -> excel , store big data -> database 
- set filter name , data type(text/number (wrong type -> no enter data))
- key / primary view (view contains data needed -> all unique (record))
- combine two key view (class + class number -> unique)
- no key view -> self gen id lor 

## common data type ##
- int (integer , no decimal place)
- float (can decimal place)
- text (including any character , symbol , use more space then char as it will reserve for large text )
- char (specific length , no length no go)
- date (save in date format (YYYY-MM-DD) )
- still a lot of data type (polygon ???? ) -> rmb 5 in dse already ok

## SQL command / query(structured query language)##
- select (SELECT (field1) , (field2) FROM (table) WHERE (condition) ORDER BY (field1) , (field2) DESC)
- remove 
- insert 
- update
