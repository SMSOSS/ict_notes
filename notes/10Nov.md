# ICT Lesson, 10 November 2021 Notes #

## 1. Question types in DSE ##
Mainly 2 types.
- Write output with given SQL commands
- Write command with given SQL output.

## 2. Notes and common mistakes ##
- The output data should be in raw output form. 
	- Do NOT output it in chart / format the output. It is NOT used for presentation.
- Common mistake 1: Adding titles to the output
	- Unnecessary and no SQL software does such thing.
- Common mistake 2: Using commas to separate data
	- Commands are only used on commands. Use spaces to separate data.

## 3. Insert command ##
- Used to insert data into table (Can be done with GUI tho)

`
INSERT INTO studentpratice ('sid' , 'class') VALUES ('29487' , 'C4')
