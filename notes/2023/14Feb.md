# ICT Lesson, 14 Feb Notes #
Welcome back :)

### 1. Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming ###
- Public
  - variable can be changed easily outside class

- Private
  - Cannot change variable outside class
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism-ed functions cannot edit the protected value
  
- Protected
  - Inheritance and Polymorphism-ed functions can edit the protected value
  - Others cannot change the protected value

### 2. ICT 2017 DSE 2D Past Paper ###
- Examples of Object-Oriented Programming Language
  - C# / C++ / C
  - Pascal
  - Python
 
- Examples of Non Object-Oriented Programming Language
  - PHP
  - Fortran
  
- How to Choose a programming language?
  - Features of a Programming Language (e.g. structures)
  - Readbility (indentation?)
  - Time efficiency (time needed for compilation & running the program) 
  - Availibility of libraries
  - Support OOP?
  - Reusablity (is compiled code reusable?)
  - Portability (can compiled code be used on other platforms?) / Cross-platform
  
### 3. Chapter Summary ###
- Generation of Programming Languages
  - 5 Generations (citation needed)
    - Generation 1: CPU instructions
    - Generation 2: Assembly
    - Generation 3: C++
    - Generation 5: AI
    
- Programming Paradigm
  - Object-Oriented Programming Languages
    - Advantages & disadvantages

### 4. Sneak peek ###
Next Chapter :)
- Program Translator
  - Convert code into CPU executable format (sort of compiler stuff)
- Will be very abstract and hard to understand (just recite it!)
