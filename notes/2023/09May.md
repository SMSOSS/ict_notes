## Proxy server ##
- E.g. Connect to other region game server 

## VPN ##
- similar to Proxy 
- form a internal network 
- E.g. home computer connect to internal network (ymc control skl network at home)

## Protection ## 
### Password ###
- Similar to a door with locked -> key = password
- without key can't access
- length (>8)
- Complexity (Combination of upper lower case , number , symbols)
- DSE : example of passowrd -> more random 
- Avoid using common combination(12345678)
- change password regularly 

### Encryption ###
- Similar to puzzle -> everyone can access but can't understand
- Encryption : let the puzzle be complete
- Hard to get message without knowing the encryption method
- E.g. wifi , https
- Symmetric encryption(same key for encryption and decryption) 
- Assymetric encryption(different key for encryption and decryption)
  - Private key/Public key encryption(PKT)
  - everyone has their private / public key(everyone know)
  - private en + public de / public en + private de
  - keep message confidental + ensure others didn't edit the message
  - can use public key to de = prove the sender(en by private key)
- key length : 2048 bits / 4096 bits
