# Waterfall model #
- Wait finish than next stage (step by step) 
- more organized / coordinated 
- design all fetures -> write code 
- drawbacks : lower efficiency (real life almost no one use ._.)

- E.g. A meet sys -> ask q 
- How to know how sys work -> observation , interview (Open end->require more time) , questionaire (Close end)
- Survey include interview , questionaire (Don't write survey and interview , only count 1 mark)
