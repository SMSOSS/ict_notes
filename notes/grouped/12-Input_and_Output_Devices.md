## Input devices ##
### Keyboards ###
- Input stuff to computers (e.g. text)
- Electronice piano are keyboard too ! ($60000 piano rich ymc xd)

### Pointing Devices ###
- Cursor (commonly known as "mouse")
- Alternatives includes :
    - Track point
    - Trackball (mouse but contolled by a ball)
- Used in GUI and rarely in CLI
    - GUI = Graphical User Interface 
        - What you usually use 
        - e.g. Windows , MacOS (Aqua WM) , most Linu distros all have GUIs
    - CLI = Comman Line Interface
        - Mostly only requires a keyboard to use 
        - Key bindings are very important (memorize!!!)
        - Mostly more efficient than GUI (GPU and others has less workload)
        - Extra : some WMs
            - Textbook won't cover this but it's common 
            - (some) Window managers in Linux do NOT require a mouse, but it is GUI
            - Some examples are i3 and BSPWM (what I use)
            - Key bindings are very important

### Drawing pads / handwriting boards ###
- Another type of pointing device 
- Simulates mouse input according to pen's behaviour
- Drawing pad are usually larger and hadnwriting boards are usually smaller 
- osu :p

### Joystick ###
- Smilar to gear (波棍) in cars
- Simulates mouse input 
    - Actually treated as a separate device, has it's own keylayout and own key functions
    - Don't write this in DSE

### Video game controllers ###
- Similar to Joystick but made for Playstation / XBOX 
- Requires additional drivers to work natively on PCs
- Similar to Joysticks so just refer to that 

### Scanners ###
- Document Scanner (Scans documents)
- Flatbed Scanner (Scans images)
- Barcode Scanner (Scans barcodes)
- QR code scanner (Scans QR codes)
- There are a lot more types of scanners that scans different stuff

## Output devices ##
### Visual Display Unit ###
- Very big category 
- Monitors 
    1. CRT (gone since long)
        - Very durable but is extremely large

    2. Plasma (gone since long)
        - Very expensive
    
    3. LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) 
        - Newer technology
        - A light behind screen give ligh 
        - Liquid Crystal change reflection rate when current pass through 
        - Different color will then be shown on screen 
    
    4. LED
        - Newer technology & similar to LCD
        - Except the points on screen glow without a light in back 
    
    5. LCD vs LED
        - Full black: LCD will not be full black (still have a bit light)
        - LED will actually be full black (that's how AMOLED  black works)
- TVS 
    - Similar with a monitor (but is NOT a monitor)
    - Can do more stuff (e.g. receive TV signals)
- TV wall 
    - Multiple TV combine to show 1 thing
- LED wall
    - Basically big LED display
    - If you walk closely you can see a lot of led light bulb 
- Touchscreens
    - Invented in HK (TM)

### Refresh rate ###
- 60Hz / 120Hz / 144Hz / 160Hz
- Higher refresh rate = more images in 1s = more times screen reloads the image
- If camera refresh rate > screen refresh rate, you may be able to see flicker in image

### Printers ###
1. Production Printer
- Large and EXTREMELY expensive 
- High quantity , can print a lot of documents shortly 
    - Used to print exam papers 
- Large paper tray (store a lot of paper)
- Fuser/drum in middle -> same as laser printer
- Inserter included 
    - Can easily batch print front pages
    - Can easily make leaflets / bind (nail) documents
- Can print ~100 pages per minute

2. Dot-matrix Printer 
- Pretty old technology 
- Cheap 
- Prints stuff by dots 
- Requires specific Dot Matrix Printer Paper 

3. Inkjet Printer
- Pretty cheap 
- Small in size 
- Preferred in households / small offices 
- Print head drops ink onto paper to form objects 

4. Laser Printer 
- Photocopier 
- Faster than Inkjet 
- More precise 
- Material for printing is cheaper
- Add +ve electrons on paper -> drum charge +ve electrons -> laser seperate drum into have/not have electrons -> carbon go to drum to form iamge -> carbon go to paper when scrolling -> fuser (100/200oc) let carbon evaporate and stick on surface of paper -> printed 
- Fuser is usually hot to make carbon stick on paper -> have warmup time (heat fuser)
- Refer to textbook page 51

5. Thermal Printer 
- Small. Quit. Cheap.
- Low resolution 
- Printed output slowly fades (not long-lasting)
- Monocolor 
- Uses special thermal paper 
- Widely seen in restaurants and supermarkets 

6. Multifunctial Printer 
- Has extra functions! (Scanning / Photocopying / Fax)

7. Plotter 
- You won't use this at home 
- Support very large paper (A1 or larger)
- Very high accuracy (widely used for construction designs and banners)
- Supports printing on special textures (e.g. Plastic)
- Extremely slow (few hours/days for one page)

### Speakers ###
- 1.1 -> 1 speakers + 1 snowoofer
- 7.1 -> 7 speakers + 1 snowoofer

### Projectors ###
- Resolution
- Input service (VGA , HDMI , DVI , Display Port)
- Brightness 
    - Measuring unit is lumen (school 3000)
    - Typical projectos have 1000-2000 hrs lifetime

1. Laser projectors 
- Same as normal projectors 
- Uses lazer instead of lamp 
- More durable (avg life of 10000 - 20000 hrs)
- More expensive than normal projectors

2. LED projector
- Same as normal projectors
- Uses a LED lamp

3. Ultra short throw projector
- Small range projector

### Cheque deposit machine(P.56) ###
- Accept cheques and print receipt slips using thermal printer

### Historical old stuff (P.72-73 , 77-78 , 81 , 85-86) ###
1. Conference room - presenter 
- Now use ipad / screencast 

2. Foppy disk / Magentic Tape / cdrom / MD
- No need revise retarded stuff

## DSE question type ###
- 功利時間 xd
- Choose printer in different situations
    - State advantages and disadvantages to support your decision
