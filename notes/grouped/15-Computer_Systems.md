## Types of Computer ##
### Network Computer(P.141) ###
- Basically a desktop computer 
- Lacks a disk drive / expansion slots 
- e.g. PoS terminal 

### Desktop Computer ###
- Single-user computer system which can be placed on a desk 
- Widely used in homes , offices and school 
- Consist of serveal expansion slots for adding expansion cards -> high ability of expansion

### Notebook Computer / Laptop ###
- Small and light-weight personnal computer designed for people on the move 
- Usually more expensive than a desktop computer with similar spec
- Highly portable

### Tablet / Mobile / Handheld Computer ###
- Very small

### Mainframe Computer ###
- Large and powerful computer 
- "Brain" of computer networks with hundreds of network computers
- Require strict control of temperature , humidity and security access

## Modes/Types of processing (P.146) ##
### Single-user Systems ###
- Computer system which process request from one user at a time 
- Single-user system / processing (Windows , whatsapp)

### Multi-user System ###
- Computer system which support two or more user simultaneously 
- Multi-user system (online booking , MMO game)

### Batch Processing ###
- Large amount = batch 
- Executes batch jobs at a scheduled time automatically without human interaction 
- e.g. Scheduled backup (Server)

### Real time ###
- Processes data immediately after it has been entered 
- Real time (Changes take effect immediately)
- Can be interactive 

### Online Interactive System ###
- Systems / server connected to the Internet 
- e.g. Online ticket reservation system , search engines 

### Parallel Processing System ###
- Handle more than one tasks at the same time 
- Usually make use of more than 1 CPU core / thread 

### Distributed Processing System ###
- Divide a task into few subtasks 
- Subtasks Distributed among different computers through network connection
