## 1. Data verification (recap) ##
- In order to reduce data errors:
    - Enter data twice
        - Same person enter data twice
    - Double entry
        - Different person enter data twice

    - Entering data twice can reduce error count as it is very rare that the two inputs will have the same error.

## 2. Presentation of information ##
    - Why Powerpoint (not microsoft word) ?
        - Slides, multimedia elements, transition effects, animation effects, etc.
            - MS Word does NOT have any of these.
        - Separation of slides
            - Title, Text, Image
        - Timing, Fully automated slides (Timed presentation)
            - Links are useless as the slide is automated. When you click a link, the whole presenation should stop just for you to view the link which makes it unfavorable
        - Interactive
            - Interaction between user and computer.
            - If there are any actions that will happen after you click something, then that is interactive.
            - Examples include: button, links (When you click, the machine gives response, i.e. open the link. That's interaction :p )
            - Challenging question: is a Video in a powerpoint interactive???

side note: powerpoint sucks, use google's material guidelines to make a video is much better
