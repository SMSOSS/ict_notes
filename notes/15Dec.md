# ICT Lesson, 15 December notes #

## 1. Videos ##

- Made up of audio (soundtrack) and a lot of images
- FPS / Frames Per Second 
	- How many pictures are there per second?
	- 60 / 90 / 120 / 144 / More (varies)
	- The higher the FPS / Frame rate, the more stuff animations "seem" to be
	- P.S: Humans can sometimes read up to 1000FPS
		- More than 1000FPS = 1000FPS because we can't even see all the frames

- Resolution / Frame Size
	- Same as picture

- Color Depth
	- The number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel
	- Usually 10 / 12 / 24 bits

- Compression ratio on audio

- Compression (same with Images)
	- 1. Lossy
		- Combine similar colors into one color
		- Smaller file size but lower quality in return
	- 2. Loseless
		- No dirty hack, save whatever is recorded
		- Large in file size

## 2. Image file types ##
- BMP (bitmap image file)
	- No compression is involved
	- Largest in file size
- JPG
	- A lot of compression
	- Smallest in file size
- PNG
	- Not that much of compression
	- Smaller in file size, compared to BMP
- GIF
	- A bunch of photos (like animation)
	- File size varies 
- TIFF (Tag Image File Format)
	- No compression is involved
	- Usually used by scanners
	- Preferred by photographers, digital artists, etc.
- RAW
	- No compression is involved
	- Usually used by scanners again
	- Extremely uncommon
	- Normal image viewers / editors can't view / edit them
